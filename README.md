# Quack-Quack-Friends
This is a mini project that I and my team developed to demonstrate the use of next generation databases.
We here designed a webApp where its users can upload files(JPG PNG GIF WEBP TIFF PSD RAW BMP HEIF INDD JPEG 2000 SVG AI EPS PDF, PNG, MP4, PDF, MP3, DOC, SVG, INI, DAT, EXE, LOG , and various other types )
and share amongst friends. 
This project uses Django as its web framework and MongoDB as database. All the pages are designed using HTML 5 and CSS.
